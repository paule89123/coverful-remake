			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Hi! Itâ€™s Lewis, CEO and founder of Coverful. Thanks for stopping by!
			</p>

			<p>
				Iâ€™ll tell you a little about me and the store, so you can begin your
				journey in full confidence that we have everything covered ðŸ˜Š
			</p>

			<p>
				I took my first step into the world of cushion covers in the spring of
				2014, working with a small team to create unique designs as gifts for
				friends and family. Over the next 6 years we gained a following of
				fellow cushion cover lovers across the UK and worldwide.
			</p>

			<p>
				Fast forward to 2020 and we have ourselves a shiny new website (which
				you are on right now!).
			</p>

			<p>Coverful is still run by me, along with a few fantastic helpers.</p>

			<p>
				Since our humble beginnings in Brighton, we have developed friendships
				and partnerships with some of the most wonderful suppliers in the UK and
				around the world, so we can bring you amazing designs at the best
				prices.
			</p>

			<p>
				Give us a shout if you have any questions, and welcome to the world of
				Coverful! ðŸ˜Š
